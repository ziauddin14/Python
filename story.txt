A proud lion was trapped in a hunter's net, roaring in frustration.
A tiny mouse appeared, but the lion laughed, thinking it was too small to help.
The mouse, however, began to gnaw through the thick ropes of the net.
After a while, the mouse successfully freed the trapped lion.
The lion, now humbled, learned that courage and help can come in any size, and he should never underestimate anyone.
